# Smart Bus Admin Panel (Flask)

This project has been converted to a Flask application.

## Structure

- `app.py`: The main Flask application file.
- `templates/`: Contains all HTML templates.
- `static/`: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python and Flask installed.
    ```bash
    pip install flask
    ```

2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Note

The original HTML, CSS, and JS files in the root directory can be safely deleted as they have been moved to `templates/` and `static/`.
